I'm an experienced software developer specializing in mobile app development. With 6 years in the field, I've mastered crafting [Android](https://developer.android.com/about) native apps using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), and creating multi-platform apps with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Additionally, I'm proficient in backend technologies like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
